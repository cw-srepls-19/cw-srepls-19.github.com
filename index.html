against Relaxed Memory Models</a>.</i> <span class="abslink" id="talk6">Abstract</span><span class="abs" id="abs6">: For performance reasons, modern multiprocessors implement
relaxed memory consistency models that admit out-of-program-order and
non-store atomic executions.  While data race-free programs are not
sensitive to these relaxations, they pose a serious problem to the
development of the underlying concurrency libraries.  Library routines
that work correctly under Sequential Consistency (SC) show undesirable
effects when run under a relaxed memory model.  These routines are not
robust against the relaxations that the processor supports.  To
enforce robustness, the programmer has to add safety net instructions
to the code that control the hardware --- a task that has proven to be
difficult, even for experts. We recently developed algorithms that
check and, if necessary, enforce robustness against prominent relaxed
memory models like TSO implemented in x86 processors and Power
implemented in IBM architectures.  Given a program, our algorithms
decide whether the actual behavior on the processor coincides with the
SC semantics.  If this is not the case, they synthesize safety net
instructions that enforce robustness.  When built into a compiler, our
algorithms thus hide the relaxed memory model from the programmer and
provide the illusion of Sequential Consistency.  In this talk, we
motivate the robustness problem and explain how to reduce it to an
emptiness problem for a new automaton model</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax_rvWzstHI&amp;t=7m44s">Video</a>.</dd>
    
<dt>13:35</dt><dd>Julien Lange (Imperial).&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/icw2015/Slides/Julien-Lange.pdf">From Communicating Machines to Graphical Choreographies</a>.</i> <span class="abslink" id="talk2">Abstract</span><span class="abs" id="abs2">: Graphical choreographies, or global graphs, are general multiparty
session specifications featuring expressive constructs such as forking,
merging, and joining for representing application-level protocols.
Global graphs can be directly translated into modelling notations such
as BPMN and UML.

In this talk, I will present (i) an algorithm whereby a global graph can
be constructed from asynchronous interactions represented by
communicating finite-state machines (CFSMs); and (ii) a sound and
complete characterisation of a subset of safe CFSMs from which global
graphs can be constructed</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax_rvWzstHI&amp;t=35m44s">Video</a>.</dd>

 We propose a method to extend ML with session types which requires 
minimal typing annotations. Our approach uses a novel
combination and extension of well-known techniques to separate the 
underlying type system of ML from the typing of sessions. This
two level approach gives rise to a straightforward inference algorithm 
for session types, which leverages and complements ML's own
type inference algorithm. Inference in our system is sound and complete 
with respect to type checking, and type soundness
guarantees a weak deadlock freedom property. We describe the inference
algorithm by example, and state the main theorems</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax_rvWzstHI&amp;t=1h54m15s">Video</a>.</dd>

multi-consumer data-structure which forms part of Dodds et al.'s time-stamped
stack. Various features of the SP pool make it challenging to verify,
including a stack-like (but possibly not linearizable) specification,
pervasive out-of-order node removal, and the presence of harmless
data-races during node disposal. As well as describing my proof, which
uses Svendsen and Birkedal's iCAP logic, I will discuss what we can
  change to make similar proofs easier in future</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax_rvWzstHI&amp;t=2h37m14s">Video</a>.</dd>

Pragmatic Study of Weak Memory Behaviours on GPUs</a>.</i> <span class="abslink" id="talk3">Abstract</span><span class="abs" id="abs3">: Current
multiprocessors implement weak memory models. That is, executions that
do not correspond to an interleaving concurrent instructions are
allowed. While much research has gone into weak memory models on
traditional CPU systems, not much attention has been given to GPUs
(graphics processing units). GPUs feature a memory and concurrency
hierarchy unseen on traditional CPU systems which must be taken into
account when reasoning about the memory model. In this talk, we will
discuss our efforts to empirically investigate the memory model
implemented on current GPUs and how the hierarchical system poses new
and interesting challenges. We present a technique for testing GPU
applications for weak memory bugs and show that we are able to observe
undesirable outcomes in several case studies. Finally, we discuss
methods of disallowing such behaviours and the associated performance
  and power cost</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax_rvWzstHI&amp;t=3h02m02s">Video</a>.</dd>

  memory models is to support program transformations - i.e. compiler
  optimisations. However, it's extremely subtle to calculate which
  transformations are valid. This talk is about a theory for program
  transformations on the C11 relaxed model. Our theory is
  compositional: for each transformation, a limited number of
  executions represent all interactions with the context. To express
  these interactions, we use a partially-ordered record called a
  history (the set of histories could be seen as a kind of
  denotation). Our theory builds on ideas from C11 library
  abstraction: replacing a specification with an implementation is one
  instance of program transformation. This work is still in progress,
  but we already cover the core of the C11 model and many important
  transformations</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax_rvWzstHI&amp;t=4h15m30s">Video</a>.</dd>

The constraints necessary on a thread‚Äôs concurrent environment to guarantee its termination 
can be specified using Total-TaDA. This allows us to verify total correctness for non-blocking 
algorithms. This approach is modular, the operations of a module can be verified independently,
and modules can be build up on top of each other</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFUbeXMN3lk&amp;t=8m13s">Video</a>.</dd>

<dt>09:25</dt><dd>Gian Ntzik (Imperial).&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/icw2015/Slides/Gian-Ntzik.pdf">Formally Specifying
  POSIX File Systems</a>.</i> <span class="abslink" id="talk15">Abstract</span><span class="abs" id="abs15">: File system operations exhibit complex behaviour: they perform multiple actions
affecting different parts of the state. This is further exacerbated when
the operations are used concurrently. POSIX is a standard for operating
systems, with a substantial part devoted to specifying file system
operations. The specification is given in English, contains ambiguities
and is generally under-specified with respect to concurrent
behaviour. Therefore, it is not clear what clients may expect and what
implementations must do.  We extend modern concurrent program logics
with a novel formalism for specifying multiple actions performed by an
operation, which may be atomic, non-atomic or a combination of both, and
give proof rules for client and implementation reasoning. With this
formalism we give a formal specification to a common fragment of POSIX
file system operations, and reason about clients such as lock files and
an implementation of half-duplex pipes</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFUbeXMN3lk&amp;t=32m51s">Video</a>.</dd>

<dt>10:10</dt><dd>Hongseok Yang (U Oxford).&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/icw2015/Slides/Hongseok-Yang.pdf">'Cause I'm Strong Enough: Reasoning about Consistency Choices in Distributed Systems</a>.</i> <span class="abslink" id="talk9">Abstract</span><span class="abs" id="abs9">: Large-scale distributed systems often rely on replicated databases that allow a
programmer to request different data consistency guarantees for different
operations, and thereby control their performance. Using such databases is far
from trivial: requesting stronger consistency in too many places may hurt
performance, and requesting it in too few places may violate correctness. To
help programmers in this task, we propose the first proof rule for establishing
that a particular choice of consistency guarantees for various operations on a
replicated database is enough to ensure the preservation of a given data
integrity invariant. Our rule is modular: it allows reasoning about the
behaviour of every operation separately under some assumption on the behaviour
of other operations. This leads to simple reasoning, which we have automated in
an SMT-based tool. We present a nontrivial proof of soundness of our rule and
illustrate its use on several examples.

This is joint work with Alexey Gotsman (IMDEA, Spain), Carla Ferreira
(Universidade Nova Lisboa), Mahsa Najafzadeh (UPMC &amp; INRIA), and
Marc Shapiro (UPMC &amp; INRIA)</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFUbeXMN3lk&amp;t=1h17m30s">Video</a>.</dd>

<dt>10:35</dt><dd>Giovanni Bernardi (IMDEA).&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/icw2015/Slides/Giovanni-Bernardi.pdf">Robustness for Parallel Snapshot Isolation</a>.</i> <span class="abslink" id="talk10">Abstract</span><span class="abs" id="abs10">: Modern distributed systems often rely on databases that achieve
scalability by providing only weak guarantees about the consistency
of data - i.e. weak consistency levels.
In these databases executions may happen, which are not serialisable,
thus one problem is to understand whether a given transactional application
performs <i>only</i> serialisable executions.

In this talk first we define formally Parallel Snapshot Isolation (PSI), 
a consistency level fit for geo-replicated databases,
that appeared recently in the literature.
Afterwards we sketch a robustness criterion for PSI,
that is a condition to check whether a transactional
application generates only serialisable executions,
even if ran over a database implementing PSI</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFUbeXMN3lk&amp;t=1h42m32s">Video</a>.</dd>

<dt>11:20</dt> <dd>Artem Khyzha (IMDEA/MSR).&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/icw2015/Slides/Artem-Khyzha.pdf">A Generic Logic
for Proving Linearizability</a>.</i> <span class="abslink" id="talk11">Abstract</span><span class="abs" id="abs11">: Linearizability is a commonly
accepted notion of correctness for libraries of concurrent algorithms,
and recent years have seen a number of proposals of program logics for
proving it.  Although these logics differ in technical details, they
embody similar reasoning principles. In our ongoing work we aim to
explicate these principles and propose a logic for proving
linearizability that is generic: it can be instantiated with different
means of compositional reasoning about concurrency, such as separation
logic or rely-guarantee. In this talk, I will present a generalisation
of the Views framework for reasoning about concurrency to handle
relations between programs, required for proving linearizability. This
is joint work with Alexey Gotsman (IMDEA) and Matthew Parkinson
(MSR)</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFUbeXMN3lk&amp;t=2h25m50s">Video</a>.</dd>

<dt>11:45</dt><dd>Gavin Lowe (U Oxford).&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/icw2015/Slides/Gavin-Lowe.pdf">Testing for Linearizability</a>.</i> <span class="abslink" id="talk18">Abstract</span><span class="abs" id="abs18">: In this talk, I will argue that testing still has a role to play in validating
concurrent datatypes.  Correctness of a concurrent datatype normally means
linearizability.  So how does one test for linearizability?

Our approach is to run several worker threads on the concurrent datatype,
record the history of operation calls and returns, and then test whether that
history is linearizable.  I will present three different algorithms for
testing whether a recorded history is linearizable, plus an interesting
combination of two of the algorithms.  I will give results of an experimental
comparison, and also present evidence that the technique is effective at
finding bugs</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFUbeXMN3lk&amp;t=2h50m10s">Video</a>.</dd>

<dt>12:10</dt> <dd>Alex Summers (ETH Zurich).&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/icw2015/Slides/Alex-Summers.pdf">Viper: Verification Infrastructure for Permission-based Reasoning</a>.</i> <span class="abslink" id="talk14">Abstract</span><span class="abs" id="abs14">:
 Modern verification techniques are becoming ever-more powerful and 
sophisticated, and building tools to implement them is a time-consuming 
and difficult task. Writing a new verifier to validate each on-paper 
approach is impractical; for this reason intermediate verification 
languages such as Boogie and Why3 have become popular over the last 
decade for implementing research from a wide variety of domains, and 
several mature tools used in industry have been built around this common
 tool stack.

Reasoning approaches which orient around sophisticated partitioning and 
organisation of the verification state (such as separation logics) have 
typically been implemented in specialised tools, since the reasoning is 
hard to map down to first-order automated reasoning. In practice (with 
notable exceptions), this means that a rich variety of modern techniques
 have no corresponding tool support.

In this talk, I will present the new Silver intermediate verification 
language, which has been designed to facilitate the lightweight 
implementation of a variety of modern methodologies for program 
verification. In contrast to lower-level verification languages, Silver 
provides native support for heap reasoning; modes of reasoning such as 
concurrent separation logic, dynamic frames and 
rely-guarantee/invariants can be simply encoded.

Silver has been developed as part of the Viper project, which provides
  two automated back-end verifiers for Silver programs. Since
  releasing our software in September last year, it has been used for
  (internal and external) projects to build tools for Java
  verification, non-blocking concurrency reasoning, flow-sensitive
  typing and reasoning about GPU and Linux kernel code</span>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFUbeXMN3lk&amp;t=3h18m5s">Video</a>.</dd>
